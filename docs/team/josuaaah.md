## Project: TAskmaster

TAskmaster is a desktop app for managing students, optimised for use
via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of
a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a CS Teaching Assistant
who can type fast, TAskmaster can help you track your students'
attendance and class participation faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
